# Software-Development-Lifecycle-in-Agile
# Project Overview
This project explores the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), focusing on the Agile methodology to manage software development in a team-based environment. The project simulates real-world scenarios, incorporating essential Agile practices like backlog grooming, sprint planning, and daily Scrum meetings. The primary objective is to develop features for the SNHU Travel project while adhering to the principles of Agile, which emphasize iterative development, continuous testing, and regular feedback from stakeholders.

# Features
The project highlights the importance of Agile roles such as the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Tech Lead. Each role contributes to the development process by managing product priorities, reducing barriers, and guiding technical solutions. The team used JIRA to create and track user stories, enabling effective backlog grooming and sprint management. Development tasks involved implementing unit tests, exception handling, and interface validations, including user registration and login screens. Regular sprint reviews and mid-iteration meetings were conducted to ensure progress and improve team performance.

# Files
The project contains the source code for the SNHU Travel application, including unit tests and features like exception handling and UI validation. Additionally, JIRA user stories were created to organize and manage tasks throughout the sprint cycles. Documentation outlining the Agile roles, SDLC phases, and sprint goals is also included, providing a comprehensive view of the project development lifecycle.
